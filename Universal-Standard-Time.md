Universal Standard Time (UST) is the standard time system in Naev.

UST consists of three basic components describing different amounts of time: the second, which is equivalent to an Earth second; the period, which is equal to 10,000 seconds; and the cycle, which is equal to 5,000 periods (50,000,000 seconds). In colloquial usage, the terms "decaperiod" (equivalent to 10 periods) and "hectosecond" (equivalent to 100 seconds) are also common. UST dates are written in the form:

* UST C:PPPP.SSSS

Where "C" is the cycle, "PPPP" is the period (always displayed as four digits), and "SSSS" is the second (always displayed as four digits). So for example, the following hypothetical date indicates cycle 493, period 42, second 2089 (which is about 100 cycles prior to [[The Incident]]):

* UST 493:0042.2089

When describing lengths of time, it is commonplace for computer systems to indicate a number of periods with a lowercase "p" or a number of seconds with a lowercase "s". This convention is not used for cycles, which are always spelled out in full as "cycles". This convention is also not adopted in spoken form since it's more natural to just say "periods" and "seconds" rather than a single-letter abbreviation. Additionally, due to the metric nature of the time system, periods and seconds can be written out as a single unit, although in spoken conversation people report the periods and cycles separately. Some examples:

* 783p (read as "783 periods")
* 42s (read as "42 seconds")
* 12.0456p (read as "12 periods and 456 seconds")

The following is a chart of all time units used in Naev along with the corresponding Earth time unit they are similar to in terms of where they are used.

| UST unit     | Abbreviation | Length of Time | Similar To |
|:-------------|:-------------|:---------------|:-----------|
| Seconds      | "s"          | 1 Earth second | Seconds    |
| Hectoseconds | N/A          | 100 seconds    | Minutes    |
| Periods      | "p"          | 1,000 seconds  | Hours      |
| Decaperiods  | N/A          | 10 periods     | Days       |
| Cycles       | N/A          | 5,000 periods  | Years      |
