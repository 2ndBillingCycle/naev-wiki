The Collective is a minor faction in Naev.

# The Facts

The Collective is a recent menace that had the bad timing to arrive more or less at the same time as the Incident. No one knows where the Collective came from (or those who do know have kept quiet), but they generally seem to be some sort of robotic hivemind that destroys all human life in its path. Collective drones are unresponsive to hails and attack any ship that approaches them without discretion. The drones are also both fast and formidable; they have a tendency to appear in large swarms, easily overwhelming any under-prepared traveler who has the misfortune of encountering them.

The Empire would have wiped out the Collective menace without difficulty if it had arrived before the Incident, but with the present political instability and turmoil, the Empire hasn't been able to direct as many resources as it would like at the problem. Still, the Collective have been contained at the Fortitude station, and Empire military personnel stationed at Omega Station ensure that the Collective doesn't escape to other systems.

Now, the Empire is nearly ready to put an end to the Collective menace once and for all. That is, assuming the Collective doesn't have more tricks up its sleeve...
