# The Hypergate

In UST standard cycle 584, [[the Empire]] was looking for ways to reassert its dominance on the universe. The Great Projects were not shaping up quite as well as the Emperor had hoped, and while most could not see it, the Empire's grasp on its control of the galaxy was slipping.

Hypergates, then, turned out to be a very fortunate discovery for the Empire. Imperial research scientists found that special gates could be designed to slip into a different reality phase, allowing ships to teleport between special gates, which the Emperor decided to call "hypergates", instantaneously. The discovery would revolutionize travel; interstellar trips would be cut down substantially, and the new hypergate technology could even possibly be used to expand further than humanity had ever dreamed. More importantly, though, the Empire would control this technology and use it to assert its dominance on the galaxy once again.

Optimistic about the project, the Emperor rushed development ahead and even had a secret experimental hypergate installed in the heart of the Empire: Sol. The origin of humanity was soon to be the origin of a new galactic expansion for the Empire. The project was kept top-secret; only a select few individuals with high security clearance were allowed to even know about the existence of the project, let alone the intricate details of how the technology worked.

Little did the Empire know, however, that [[House Proteron]] was aware of the project, and it was eager to use the technology against the Empire.

# The Incident

House Proteron knew that gathering intelligence would be essential if they were to overthrow the Empire and take control of the galaxy for itself. So the Proteron planted several spies in the ranks of the Empire, including one within the upper ranks trusted with the hypergate project, giving them full access to the results of the Empire's research. The Proteron were also able to do their own independent research and build their own secret hypergate.

In Standard Cycle 593, House Proteron came up with a plan: with the help of their spy, they would hack the system of the Sol hypergate. They would then move into the Sol system, the heart of the Empire, using their own hypergate, overwhelming the Empire in an instant shockwave of military might. The Empire would be crushed instantly and the Proteron would assume full control of the galaxy, claiming their rightful spot.

But then something went wrong.

On UST 593:3726.4659, the final stage of the plan was finally put into motion. Using the Proteron hypergate, a massive swarm of ships began the process to warp toward Sol. The Proteron's period of triumph was at hand.

But they didn't make it. The Proteron's hacking of the Sol hypergate had caused it to malfunction. Instead of warping the Proteron ships in like it was supposed to, a cataclysmic explosion rifted through the very fabric of time and space, obliterating Sol and a rather wide range of other nearby systems. Alpha Centauri, Polaris, Rauthia, Nasona, Tide, Aet, and many other once prosperous Empire systems were more or less turned completely to dust.

This was the event that would become known as [[The Incident]]. South of the Nebula, no one would find out the cause. Even the Empire itself couldn't piece together what had happened, since all those who worked on the hypergate project were now dead, including the then-Emperor himself.

But the Proteron were hit the hardest. While not annihilated as those on the southern end of the Nebula have speculated, nearly all of the Proteron worlds were wiped out, important personnel were killed, and the experimental hypergate the Proteron had built was destroyed. Once a major economic force on the galaxy, the Proteron were now decimated and cut off from the rest of the galaxy.

# The Proteron

The Incident had severed all the major jump routes between House Proteron and the rest of the galaxy, effectively marooning the worlds that survived behind an impenetrable barrier. The Proteron, discarding their old and now meaningless title, began to rebuild. Without trade and communications, it was completely left to its own devices. A period of regression followed where the authorities abandoned the idea of war for expansion, economic development and population growth. Nonetheless, slowly but surely, the Proteron regained the strength they had lost in that single disaster.

The Proteron have now once again set its sight on the rest of the galaxy. As the only ones with continued knowledge of hypergates, they have investigated into the problem that caused the Incident and fixed it, and they have continued to investigate possible ways to get past the Nebula. It's only a matter of time before the Proteron strikes again.

The Proteron have no knowledge of the state of the galaxy other than their records from before the Incident, but their leaders assume that the Empire will not nearly have recovered as fast as Proteron, if at all, and should therefore not present an obstacle to conquest. And the Proteron may well be right. With the Empire severely weakened, House Dvaered making war on its weaker neighbors and dealing with internal conflicts, House Sirius on the verge of collapsing in on itself, and House Za'lek preoccupied with whatever it is they're guarding, the galaxy seems ill-prepared to deal with the full force of the Proteron onslaught...
