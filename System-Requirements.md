# Dependencies

For Windows and Mac OS X users, our releases contain all necessary dependencies. Only users running Linux or other operating systems need to locate dependencies themselves.

The Naev dependencies are meant to be quite common on most systems. They are:

* SDL 1.2 (or newer)
* SDL_image
* SDL_mixer
* OpenGL
* libxml 2
* Freetype 2
* libpng 1.2 (or newer)
* OpenAL
