These are some ideas for storylines that could fit into the world of Naev. If you have an idea, but are unsure if it's appropriate for the setting, or if it would fit into the larger narrative that Naev already has, talk with us on [IRC][] or [Discord][].

Some of these ideas are already being implemented, while others are ready to be turned into a mission in the game.

There have been lots of ideas proposed over the years, and with the loss of the old website, these are only somewhat accessible through [archive.org][]:

- [Forum][]
- [Google Group][]

Work is being done to port that content to this document. Follow that progress at [[Porting Progress]].

To learn how to write missions for Naev's game engine, see the [[Mission Scripting]] tutorial. All of the missions that are currently playable in the game are written this way, so if there's an event from the game that looks cool, you can find the corresponding mission script in [`dat/missions/`][dat-missions].

## Neutral Mission Ideas

These are general missions that can be found in most systems and are not generally tied to a specific faction.

### The Conspiracy Theorist

A successful, aging businessperson commissions you to investigate a number of increasingly-improbable conspiracies, growing progressively more agitated as you fail to find evidence that supports the conspiracy theories. Eventually, deciding that you're working for the conspiracy and involved in a plot to kill them, the businessperson sends mercenaries after you and goes into hiding.

### The Simulated Universe

Someone is convinced they are in a simulation and wants to try to get out. They keep on making the player try more and more extreme things to have the player prove the person's theory. The final mission is too extreme, and the person perishes.

## Za'lek Mission Ideas

### The Drone Recovery

Disable and retrieve a runaway drone for a Za'lek scientist.

_Currently being implemented by [fartoverflow][]_

### Bioweapon

A Za'lek scientist hires you to disable and board progressively larger Soromid ships, to collect tissue samples. Some time after you deliver the final sample, the scientist contacts you again to tell you they have used the samples to develop an airborn virus that infects Soromid ships. The scientist hires you one last time to deploy the bioweapon at a Soromid shipyard, after which you must escape from the pursuing Soromid forces.

### Runaway Assistant

A Za'lek scientist's assistant contacts you through the mission computer and asks you to transport some of their belongings offworld. Once in space it turns out the "assistant" is an artificial intelligence, and the belongings are the server hardware on which it runs. You are to smuggle the AI to Dvaered space, where nobody will look for it.

## FLF Mission Ideas

### Dirty Dirty Bomb

This idea has its own page: [[Dirty Dirty Bomb]].

Summary: FLF morality and the bombing of civilians.

## Other

### Ultimate Lifeform

This idea has its own page: [[Ultimate Lifeform]].

Summary: The Soromid have created a synthetic life form that is out of control.
