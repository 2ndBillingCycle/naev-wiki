This page lists ideas for missions which have not yet been implemented into Naev.

# Neutral Mission Ideas

These are general missions that can be found in most systems and are not generally tied to a specific faction.

## The Conspiracy Theorist

A successful, aging businessperson commissions you to investigate a number of increasingly-improbable conspiracies, growing progressively more agitated as you fail to find evidence that supports the conspiracy theories. Eventually, deciding that you're working for the conspiracy and involved in a plot to kill them, the businessperson sends mercenaries after you and goes into hiding.

## The Simulated Universe

Someone is convinced he is in a simulation and wants to try to get out. He keeps on making the player try more and more extreme things to have the player prove his theory with the person in question dying at the end.

# Za'lek Mission Ideas

## The Drone Recovery

Disable and retrieve a runaway drone for a Za'lek scientist -- currently being implemented by fart

## Bioweapon

A Za'lek scientist hires you to disable and board progressively larger Soromid ships, to collect tissue samples. Some time after you deliver the final sample, the scientist contacts you again to tell you he has used the samples to develop an airborn virus that infects Soromid ships. The scientist hires you one last time to deploy the bioweapon at a Soromid shipyard, after which you must escape from the pursuing Soromid forces.

## Runaway Assistant

A Za'lek scientist's assistant contacts you through the mission computer and asks you to transport some of his belongings offworld. Once in space it turns out the "assistant" is an artificial intelligence, and the belongings are the server hardware on which it runs. You are to smuggle the AI to Dvaered space, where nobody will look for it.
