These are some ideas for storylines that could fit into the world of Naev. If you have an idea, but are unsure if it's appropriate for the setting, or if it would fit into the larger narrative that Naev already has, talk with us on [IRC][] or [Discord][].

Some of these ideas are already being implemented, while others are ready to be turned into a mission in the game.

There have been lots of idea proposed over the years, and with the loss of the old website, these are only somewhat accessible through [archive.org][]:

- [Forum][]
- [Google Group][]

Work is being done to port that content to this document. Follow that progress at [[Porting Progress]].

To learn how to write missions for Naev's game engine, see the [[Mission Scripting]] tutorial. All of the missions that are currently playable in the game are written this way, so if there's an event from the game that looks cool, you can find the corresponding mission script in [`dat/missions/`][dat-missions].

## Neutral mission ideas

These are general missions that can be found in most systems and are usually not tied to a specific faction.

### Absent-minded merchant

A merchant with a slow ship suddenly realizes he can't make the delivery and implores the player (with a fast ship presumed) to do it for him. Since he has to look good with his employers he'll pay the player a bonus if he does it.

_Has been sort of implemented as anxious merchant_

### The ruse

A man asks you to help him locate his brother. Upon finding the brother and docking with his ship, your employer promptly shoots the "brother". The man was actually a hitman, and he used the you to further his end.

_Currently being implemented by [fartoverflow][]_

### The drone recovery

Disable and retrieve a runaway drone for a Za'lek scientist.

_Currently being implemented by [fartoverflow][]_

### Runaway assistant

A Za'lek scientist's assistant contacts you through the mission computer and asks you to transport some of his belongings offworld. Once in space it turns out the "assistant" is an artificial intelligence, and the belongings are the server hardware on which it runs. You are to smuggle the AI to Dvaered space, where nobody will look for it.

### Insane businessman

A successful, aging businessman commissions you to investigate a number of increasingly-improbable conspiracies, growing progressively more agitated as you fail to find evidence that supports his conspiracy theories. Eventually, deciding that you're working for the Man and involved in a plot to kill him, he sends mercenaries after you and goes into hiding.

### The simulated universe

Some guy has gone crazy and is convinced he is in a simulation and wants to try to get out. He keeps on making the player try crazier and crazier things to have the player prove his theory with the guy in question dying at the end.


## Za'lek Missions

### Bioweapon

A Za'lek scientist hires you to disable and board progressively larger Soromid ships, to collect tissue samples. Some time after you deliver the final sample, the scientist contacts you again to tell you he has used the samples to develop an airborn virus that infects Soromid ships. The scientist hires you one last time to deploy the bioweapon at a Soromid shipyard, after which you must escape from the pursuing Soromid forces.


## FLF Missions

### Dirty Dirty Bomb

Too long to have here: [[Dirty Dirty Bomb]]. Basically FLF morality and the bombing of civilians.


## Other

### Ultimate Lifeform

Too long to have here: [[Ultimate Lifeform]]. Basically Soromid have created a synthetic life form that is out of control.
